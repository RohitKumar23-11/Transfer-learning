# Transfer-learning
Transfer learning is leveraging a working model's existing architecture and learned patterns for our own problem.

There are two main benefits:
1. Can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work on problems similar to our own.
2. Can leverage a working neural network architecture which has already learned patterns on similar data to our own, then we can adapt those patterns to our own data.

This repository have 3 file every one have there own properties related to transfer learning. And they are 
1. Feature extraction
2. Fine tuning
3. Scaling-up
